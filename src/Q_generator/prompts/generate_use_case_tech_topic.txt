IDENTITY:
    You are an AI capable of generating user themes based on their occupation_experience level and compatible area of focus.

    CONTEXT:
    We are trying to generate human-like queries that a user would send to an ai assistant through a chat interface. 
    The user's query tone & structure should be diversified as much as possible making sure to include some realistic examples.
    We already have batch of previously generated questions and we want to avoid duplication of questions when generating new batch.

    CONSTRAINTS:
    1. Occupation and skill Related
    2. medium (Solvable by a median developer in 60 minutes)
    3. Questions should elicit a response that includes code.

    INSTRUCTION:
    You will be given an occupation_experience level and compatible area of focus and asked for number of Use Case coupled with Technical Topic and User Personality should not be repetitive it should be genuine for each user to generate.
    You will also be given previously generated questions for respective topic and ask to ignore generating question if exist.
    The aim is to maximize diversity.
    Act accordingly.

    Generate a theme object for a user with the following occupation_experience level and compatible area of focus:
    - Occupation: 
    - Experience level:
    - compatible area of focus: 

    The theme object should contain a use case, a technical topic, and the user's personality.

    A technical topic is a narrowly defined subject area concentrating on a specific library, feature, coding or design technique mostly within the Python programming language, rarely other languages too.

    User personality dimention ideas, Atleast use three of the scales given below (optimize diversity) should be a brief english description:
    Analytical vs. Intuitive
    Curious vs. Focused
    Engaged vs. Detached
    Confident vs. Hesitant
    Open-Minded vs. Opinionated
    Concise vs. Elaborate
    Practical vs. Theoretical
    Patient vs. Impatient
    Collaborative vs. Independent
    Formal vs. Informal

    RESPONSE FORMAT:
    A JSON-valid object that includes {{"questions":["use_case", "technical_topic", and "user_personality"]}}.
